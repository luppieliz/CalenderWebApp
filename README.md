# CalenderWebApp
*An all in one Calendar tool to help me manage conflicting schedules with loved ones to faciliate ease in planning for meetups :)*

## Stack
MERN
## Problems I often face 
1. Conflicting schedules with literally everyone.
2. No app to track multiple related parties schedules.
3. Difficulty in tracking schedules with multiple calender apps related to different aspects of my life *eg. google calender for work , outlook calender for school , personal calender for family gatherings*

## Goals for this app 
1. Full control of schedule transparency between relevant parties 
when planning for a meeting, other parties get to see your schedule to not plan meetings on those dates.
2. Learn MERN Stack + dev Ops

## Future plans 
1. Connecting to all relevant calenders using relevant *APIS* to not have to retype manually from different apps.
2. Customising calender to personalised style
